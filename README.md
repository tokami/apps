This repository collects clicked-based version of a range of assessment methods
for educational purposes. So far it includes the methods:

## SPiCT
The stochastic production model in continuous time (SPiCT; Pedersen and Berg,
2017) is one of the official stock assessment methods of the International
Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES; ICES, 2017). The official
repository of the method can be found in [this repository on
GitHub](https://github.com/DTUAqua/spict).

## Length-based stock assessment with TropFishR
TropFishR is a compilation of a range of different data-limited assessment
methods. It is available on CRAN, but constantly developed further in [this
repository on GitHub](https://github.com/tokami/TropFishR).
